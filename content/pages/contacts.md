The best way to reach me is by [email](mailto:m.walmsley@utoronto.ca). 

I have many more ideas to try out and astronomy datasets to explore than I could ever deal with myself.
Reach out if you're a prospective student or an established researcher looking for an ML challenge.
And of course, I'm always happy to chat about your own cool research ideas or interesting tech projects.

Some themes of my ongoing work:
- Self-supervised contrastive learning
- Transformers at (astronomy-relative) scale
- Bayesian inference over noisy crowdsourced labels
- Archive hunting for the rare and scientifically-interesting
- Finetuning large models with minimal data
