I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Manchester, applying deep learning research breakthroughs to astrophysics.


I did my DPhil at Oxford (Christ Church), where I developed a state-of-the-art active learning approach to classify  million galaxies with crowdsourcing and Bayesian convolutional neural networks. I also set a new benchmark at detecting merging galaxies. You can read more about my research projects [here](/pages/research).

Previously, I worked at fintech startup Cytora using machine learning and messy open data to price insurance. And way back when, I studied Theoretical Physics MPhys (5 years) at the University of Edinburgh.
