I work on applying deep learning research breakthroughs to astrophysics.
I focus on combining crowdsourcing and deep learning to do better science than with either alone.
Much of this work is as Technical Lead for citizen science project [Galaxy Zoo](https://www.galaxyzoo.org).
You can read more about my research projects [here](/pages/research).

I'm currently a Dunlap Fellow at the University of Toronto.

I was previously a postdoc (PDRA) at the University of Manchester, supervised by Anna Scaife and working on the foundation model experiments that led to my Fellowship. I did my DPhil at Oxford, where I developed a state-of-the-art active learning approach to classify  million galaxies with crowdsourcing and Bayesian convolutional neural networks (see this [official TensorFlow blog](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/05/galaxy-zoo-classifying-galaxies-with-crowdsourcing-and-active-learning.html)). I also set a new benchmark at detecting merging galaxies.
Before that, I worked at fintech startup [Cytora](https://cytora.com/) using machine learning and messy open data to price insurance.
